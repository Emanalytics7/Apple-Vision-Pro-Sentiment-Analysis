 Vision Pro: I walked into my demo yesterday knowing I wasn’t going to buy it based on the comprehensive review posted on 
@UploadVR
 HOWEVER. the display is stunning. like UNREAL."
"Happy Headlines:  Ready to dive into the future? The Apple Vision Pro takes you on an out-of-this-world journey with its groundbreaking VR/AR experience. From spatial computing to immersive videos, it's a tech game-changer! Check out the full scoop here: …"
Last night I got to try the Apple Vision Pro and HOLY COWWWW!!! Everyone you gotta schedule a demo with your local Apple Store just for the experience!!!  It makes me so excited for the future of technology and all the possibilities that will be open.
"The secret sauce of Apple Vision pro is
- demo culture 
- user obsession 
- secrecy (Apple is just as secretive internally as it is externally)

Looking at this I don’t think apple looks for profitability but rather focuses on creating uncompromising user experience"
"Will say this again - Apple Vision Pro changes the concert viewing experience forever 

You’ll see a new economy"
Just used the Apple vision pro for the first time and that’s such a cool experience.
"Tried the Apple Vision Pro in the Apple Store yesterday. Here’s my review!

Guided demo: A+. Excellent experience, environment, and helpfulness. Took mere minutes to get my prescription and fit dialed in for a personalized device demo. (1/6)"
"unpopular opinion, or maybe not so much, but the apple vision pro is so scary  like the vibes it gives me and the realisation that how fast the world is changing"
"Having tried the Apple Vision Pro today, it's clear: this is the future of entertainment at least, blending reality and digital like never before.

Best tech experience in my life so far"
"Wow this is mind blowing, so many applications… Apple Vision Pro has the potential to revolutionize medicine. 
Its advanced eye-tracking technology and mixed reality capabilities offer benefits for medical tasks, patient data review, and surgical procedures!…"
"Just finished the Apple Vision Pro Demo at the Apple Store. It was definitely a dope experience! The future is here in Tech! Thanks 
@Apple
. Now, if I could just get one for my STEM scholars to experience! "
"I just played around with magic leap 1 after using Apple Vision Pro for two weeks. 

I think the 2018 magic leap is still actually the better experience for augmented reality.

Overlay is much better than pass through for AR. 

Looking forward to the xreal ultra. "
"You would think after the critical review by

"There is a magical experience that the Apple Vision Pro (AVP) creates that many people aren’t talking about. It's not just about just immersion, it is about shifting your consciousness and accessing flow. 

tldr; - The essence of this experience is that the AVP allows me to be…"
"Today, I decided to return my Apple Vision Pro, and it's clear I wasn't alone in my experience. The reason for my return? It felt overwhelmingly uncomfortable. As I went through the return process, which was relatively swift at 15 minutes, I noticed two other individuals also…"
"Many people are returning the #Apple Vision Pro.

Reason?

14 days (return period) are enough to record some videos to review it and publish on social media… "
"After using Apple Vision Pro’s IMAX app I’m kind of sour on IMAX as a sort of bad meatspace facsimile of the one true IMAX experience, which is VR in your favorite lounge chair, sitting in the front row of the theatre, with no neck pain from looking up."
ducktaping an apple vision pro to my opp and putting everything they see through the sora ai model so they can experience man made horrors every 60 seconds.
"How I think Apple Vision Pro could improve the skiing experience and the snow sports industry for the better:

"Who has Apple Vision Pro in Gurgaon/Delhi NCR 

I think I’ll get contact lenses made first lol but I really need to experience it once"
Meta should be happy the Apple Vision Pro was too expensive cause making a review video not even a full 2 weeks after its release doesn’t scream “we have a better product” … really if it was < $1500 everyone would’ve had one regardless of the features
After two weeks of using Apple Vision Pro I have burst blood vessels in my eyes and chronic headaches and neck pain. This is what a $3500 premium experience feels like.
Schizophrenic people getting the apple vision pro experience without the glasses 
So Steve Jobs came and talked to me during my Apple Vision Pro demo at the Apple Store today.  Anyone else have that experience?
"Apple Vision Pro comprehensive in-depth review coming tomorrow 

(over 10,000 words, all written inside Vision Pro)"
"I think Apple Vision Pro is the damn best product ever built, no contest.

For ex: I put them on, looked at my AWS billing page, and it showed me my bill at 50% of what we usually spend. 

Virtual Reality is here, folks. Its real."
"In light of the discourse around Mark Zuckerberg’s review of Apple Vision Pro, it’s worth noting that after two weeks in market, the top AVP use case is creating video content about the AVP to drive social media impressions. We’re still early."
"Having an opinion on what everybody else is doing (like commenting on Apple Vision Pro right now) is not having an opinion.

Not partaking in the collective BS and living your own life is having an opinion."
"Apple Vision Pro users are now seeking refund despite loving the experience. 

Users are reporting health issues like headaches, motion sickness.

Yes, they will get a full refund as well. 

Customer is really king in the West."
"Meta Quest 3 - awesome VR gaming console with mixed reality experiences. Great for gaming, fitness, movie watching is pretty cool too. 

Apple Vision Pro - high end mixed reality computer. Great for multitasking, productivity, collaboration, best movie watching experience."
7 word Apple Vision Pro review: Very cool but made me feel sick. Weird thing is that I spend 100+ hours a year on the open ocean and am basically never affected by motion...
Although I am not a big fan of AR/VR headsets simply because it's just way uncomfortable I decided to try Apple Vision Pro. It was a great experience especially the immersive experience. But the flip side is that it strained the eyes pretty bad the next day. #AppleVisionPro

Just a thought… Virtual Reality (#VR)technology has the potential to revolutionize radiology training. 

Incorporating VR into training programs could be groundbreaking and provide a unique learning experience for medical imaging."
"since I know, no influencer is gonna tell you this in their review: the apple vision pro does indeed sometimes mistake your dick as part of your hand & will include it in the dynamic occlusion, making it superb for spatialing one out"
"unpopular opinion: i have always thought of multiple displays as something more distracting than useful. 

i'm ok with just a single mac display on the apple vision pro. in fact, i don't miss having a second one (at all)"
" Zuckerberg's recent post about his product surpassing Apple Vision Pro shows true leadership, healthy competition, and the best of an open market.

It has improved my opinion of him as a business leader.

Reminder: be open, honest, and have unwavering belief in your products."
What is one small software update that would improve your Apple Vision Pro experience?
"One area where Apple Vision Pro has a huge opportunity to revolutionize a user experience: Home repair/building.

Imagine the software giving you good tutorials as you are changing a light fixture or installing kitchen cabinets."
"so maybe it's an unpopular opinion but I don't like how Apple Vision Pro looks. I don't like seeing it on people's faces. we're disconnected enough. Apple's efforts to show seamless connection to outside world is just weird. 

the device is an engineering marvel."
"While my opinion may not carry as much weight, I'd like to share my perspective on the matter.

Apple Vision Pro is perhaps one of the least innovative Apple products to date. "
"All the mid-tier tech YouTubers this week: ""Why I'm returning the Apple Vision Pro."" They say it's not ready for prime time, it's uncomfortable, etc. The Truth: They bought it to review it and never planned on keeping it."

"Apple Vision Pro - I have a 98” TV for viewing with my wife. But when we are not watching together I would choose the 30 foot iMax Theater experience I get from the VP every time. It has replaced my iPad, iPhone, and entire office setup (when I am not live). Game changer! #matrix"

"Finally got to play with my new Apple Vision Pro.

I saw the video of a guy wearing Apple Vision Pro on a train and working. It made me think how women may never do that. A huge part of the female experience is to be aware of your surroundings. We are very good at sensing danger. We observe how men look at us.

But I still want to try one out."
"This is my post about the new Apple Vision Pro.

"My honest review of the Apple Vision Pro:

Out of the box on launch day, it's not worth the price tag. 

There's not a ton you can do with it yet. 

HOWEVER

In 2-3 months it will be worth 3x - 4x that price tag. 

Spatial Computing is bigger than ChatGPT and it's not even close."
"I lived inside Apple Vision Pro for two weeks and no one noticed. :( So far my solitary existence is largely unaffected in spite low latency, color accuracy, excellent center sharpness... Human connection remains out of reach. Full review coming soon. Battery life not great."
"If you hear a review of the Apple Vision Pro that doesn't start with ""It's amazing, but..."" then they didn't actually try it."
Is it just me or is the Apple Vision Pro being pushed way too hard? I searched “Apple Vision Pro” cause I was curious to see if someone did a serious review of it and everything was way too positive. There wasn’t a single person showing concern for using it in public.
"My impression about Apple Vision Pro after seeing a lot of reviews; the tech is impressive, it’s something that we never saw before. But I don’t see why any of the things that people do on the device can’t just be done on the iPad instead!.."
"A lot of people have asked me about reviewing the Apple Vision Pro...and while I'm not a 100% hater like many people, I have some neck issues that I feel would make it incredibly uncomfortable based on reviews I've seen from others. Probably will hold off at least 1 gen to see…"

Version 2.1.1 is up for review and addresses an issue where sharing to DoMarks from a Share Sheet in Apple Vision Pro would not properly dismiss the sharing view in the host app.
BTW - I want the Apple Vision Pro to not suck. We need Apple to move the needle on the market sector for all players (startups included). The reviews are all over the map (from walks on water to dog poop). I can immediately see the good and bad design choices (painful for me to…

All the Apple vision pro reviews and nobody wants to tell us what watching porn is like.
"Anyone else feel apprehensive about product reviews of the Apple Vision Pro from the first batch of buyers. So far, I'm not impressed, it's not something I want, definitely don't need. Seeing a barrage of pretentious users with tons of money that wanted to show off isn't helping."

The Apple Vision Pro is not it (although, given the reviews, a good first attempt).

But they have everything they need to top Google OpenAI and Meta in gen AI except... an LLM. I think that's the easiest part.

People like to compare generative AI…"
"Yeah, after looking at a few Apple Vision Pro reviews.. it's definitely doing less for a bigger price tag than a Quest 3... 

The ""1st gen product"" argument is lame since Apple loves calling stealing inventing, and there's plenty to steal from Oculus/Meta's experiences!"
any reviews on using the Apple Vision Pro for coding?
"Most of the Apple Vision Pro reviews: 30% just excited to show you that they have one, 30% just fun to play with a new expensive toy, 30% just amazed at AR/VR/passthrough because it’s all new (to them), 10% it’s legitimately a bad ass device."
"I know it’s outrage bait but based on what I’ve seen in reviews the Apple Vision Pro doesn’t even work when you’re in motion in a car or subway train, so are all of these videos just people faking it for outrage clickbait??? I fucking hate the internet now dude."
"Esse Apple Vision Pro é bem foda, vendo aqui o review dos gringos "
People are upset with what device an individual creator decides to review ...If I were an American YouTuber I too would concentrate on Apple Vision Pro. See the views on 3 Vision pro videos... Simple
Marques had made more than 4 Apple Vision Pro reviews already. 
"Given how many Apple Vision Pro demos and reviews I’m seeing, I’m going to call the release a smashing success."
PRO Tip: if your going to watch any Apple Vision Pro reviews. Make sure its a channel dedicated to VR. BIG Non VR channels getting excited over a laser pointer is rather cringe and shows the level of understanding for this device! #VR #AppleVisionPro
"Thread: Here is my quick review of the Apple Vision Pro. I had the chance to work on it a lot. I think a good first test is to try the Quest 3, then the Vision Pro, then the Q3 again. You'll see how far the Vision Pro is. But you can do mostly the same things on both devices 1/4"
"After many reviews, Apple Vision Pro's features didn't wow me, but it's fair to compare it with similar VRs, not Quest 3 or Pro. Thrilled it's attracting more eager Apple fans, a demographic with a keen purchasing desire, extending beyond just tech enthusiasts."
"The Apple Vision Pro reviews I have seen so far has been really interesting. Lots of features... Some down sides in my opinion though of course apart from the price. 
Still waiting for

MKBHD and CaseyNeistat got some pretty good Apple Vision Pro review lowkey want one ngl  maybe in the future??

Okay now I’m tired of “Trying apple vision pro for 24 hours” reviews
"I'm seeing so much hype over the Apple Vision Pro. My quick review w/o having used it... it's a chunky device you wear on your head. This knocks out at least 70% of society from using it.

Apple Vision Pro review videos feel like seeing GTA trailer releases
I watched the first Marquis B. review of Apple Vision Pro. I could not stop thinking that remote surgery is a perfect use of this thing. With Tesla bot the surgeon can literally be anywhere in the world.
"The “but but but..” crowd in reaction to the Apple Vision Pro makes me smirk. Like you really think Apple put 14 years into this thing just hoping it would catch on? The early reviews confirm, this is a paradigm shift."

The best review of the system itself is The Verge - one of the best reviews of any product I’ve ever watched"
"I'm not going to trust any of these positive apple vision pro reviews until it's written by someone other than a tech-focused dork. let my mom write one, you cowards"
My Review of Apple Vision Pro: Very cool.  Would love to demo it every 4 years or so
"Even after watching review videos about Apple Vision Pro, I don’t want to experience it. The biggest weak point is the heavy weight. Wearing it for over an hour is like a torture to me. I know Apple tries to solve the problem, but the company could not do it enough."
"I wanted to get this review of the

Watching reviews of the Apple Vision Pro .... really feels like we're advancing to the future . Madness .  Just do me a favour and make them Pagh compatible 
watching apple vision pro unboxing videos and reviews like I have the money for one
These Apple Vision Pro reviews are making me a believer. Comparing it to a MacBook on your eyes vs an iPhone pricewise is smart.

All these Apple Vision Pro reviews are hilarious
Such conflicting reviews about Apple Vision Pro 
"It is great to see all of the reviews of the new Apple Vision Pro. I don’t know that I need one (yet) and the price is  (but probably fair for the tech)… but I do want to try. 

I was thrown by use of AVP in some reviews. Why would they be talking about Alien vs Predator? "
the best part of all the apple vision pro reviews is me being able to see what everyones houses are decorated like
"My feed is filled with glowing reviews of the Apple Vision Pro. I don’t remember people being this excited about the iPhone.

I suspect it will be a hit product, maybe not for this iteration due to the price, but once prices come down to ~$1k in the second or third generation…"
"the only review of the apple vision pro that anyone should actually care about:

yes it’s phenomenal for porn. 3D porn is going to be stupid on this & can’t wait for spatial porn audio too.

overall 9/10."
the mixed reviews of the apple vision pro have finally got me researching this thing. first of all its way overpriced. i wouldve really liked to have been in the board room when these decisions were made i just dont understand the rationale.
Saw MKBHD's review of the Apple Vision Pro and its Persona avatars are actually crazy. The avatars you're able to create in a couple minutes mirrors the fidelity of those that I've seen from performance capture studios PLUS semi-reasonable hair .
"From reading reviews of the Apple Vision Pro, I don’t know that I’ve ever seen such discrepancies. Passthrough is either crap or incredible, foveated rendering is either perfect or really noticeable, it’s either heavy or people got weak necks. 

Why the huge variance in reported…"
"Go demo Apple Vision Pro if you’re near an Apple Store 

Do this before u watch any reviews and review it for yourself. 

The eye tracking blew my mind personally"
Watched the Apple Vision Pro reviews. Impressive tech. Not worth the current price. Same can be done on a Meta Quest 3 for 1/6 the cost. Looking forward to future iterations.
LinkedIn and Twitter feeds are full of Apple Vision Pro reviews these days.
"trying to find a good enough reason to purchase the apple vision pro. but based on reviews, i’ll wait for the next or when the price drops. spending almost 4k just isn’t justifiable yet."
Watched a few Apple Vision Pro reviews/testing yesterday and can’t say I’m impressed. I think I expected more but at the same time didn’t? Maybe the price point I assumed it would do more. New tech but seems sorta aimless for a lot of general consumers. Time will tell.

"After watchign an in depth review of the Apple Vision Pro, it looks to me like Apple Innovated Google Cardboard with an external battery pack in 2024. I like the quest 3 a lot, but it could have just had Google Play preinstalled."
"I’ve been looking at Apple Vision Pro reviews and it sounds like the FOV is quite a bit less than Quest 2, Quest 3 & PS VR2 despite having so much more resolution. If you’ve tried it comment with your observations compared to any other VR headset you’ve tried. #TechTalk topic? "
I told you the Apple Vision Pro would change everything and now you see what I was talking about with everyone’s review of it. I knew it was the future when Microsoft first introduced this 7 years ago. Most innovate tech since the iPhone 1!  #gamechanger

This is by far the most awesome VR experience I have ever had. The visual clarity is so good for screens, it feels retina-level, and I feel like the amount of information you can absorb is…"
"After watching some of 
@SadlyItsBradley
's livestream of Apple Vision Pro (along with the mainstream reviews), the number one thing I think Meta needs to address with the Quest 3 is HAND occlusion. It doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to be there."
"He visto reviews de las Apple Vision Pro y no hay duda que son High Technology.
No obstante, es inverosímil ver como la gente traga, con los precios tan desproporcionados que ha puesto Apple. Desde 3500$ las gafas, 200$ la batería y 200$ la funda de transporte. ¿Estamos locos?"
"1 hour Apple Vision Pro review:

1. I cannot believe how crisp the native UI is – an engineering marvel.
2. Passthrough feels depressing not magic.
3. The thing is heavy and you never forget you're wearing it.
4. The gesture based input is designed for consumption."
"Watching videos and reviews on the Apple Vision Pro really doesn’t do any justice. It’s one of those products where you have to see for itself and well worth it if your into film, photography, run a business, great for meetings, great spatial space for multiple screens. It runs…"
"Interesting watching the initial reactions to the Apple Vision Pro. Mostly positive “new car smell” kinds of reviews. I’m avoiding Version 1.0, but watching closely and really hoping this is a hit for whatever is next in our technology evolution $AAPL"
"These Apple Vision Pro reviews (from actual buyers & not just media accounts) seem to be overwhelmingly positive. 

A common takeaway is people saying their 70”+ television screens and other 2D screens seem immediately outdated & not as exciting to watch/interact with.

The price…"
"Augmented reality was always going to be more useful than virtual reality and it’s cool to see reviews of the Apple Vision Pro talking about this great step in that direction.

I need these 256gb Apple Vision Pro reviews to come out. If I actually try and buy this thing I'm definitely getting the base model + a bluetooth keyboard.
"Apple Vision Pro is looking good based on reviews. It looks like they pulled off mastering the usability and making a polished experience.. as well as best-in-class hardware?

Going to be interesting to see where this leads, maybe I'll buy the next generation?"
"Saw a review for the super expensive Apple Vision Pro since it released today. While the main focus of the Vision Pro, Augmentation Reality (AR), is extremely amazing; everything else about it is limiting or bad. Also not many apps available (no YouTube, no Netflix, no Spotify)"
"take apple vision pro reviews with a grain of salt.

early stages of any new (bold) product are usually awkward.

the first generation smart phones lacked copy&paste functionality and the battery life stunk..

"I've been watching some reviews of the Apple Vision Pro. I'd love to try one out, but it does seem as though it's a tool searching for a job. Will people ever choose a headset over a laptop for mobile computing? Maybe when they're light enough?"
remember how ''radical'' it seemed to call our current day dystopian just a few years ago and now everybody is at peace with it to the point where the word gets thrown at reviews of the apple vision pro ....
"Idk if it’s just me, but after seeing all the early reviews of Apple Vision Pro, it feels very underwhelming to me.

Not sure what I was expecting, given that it’s primarily a VR experience that we’re all familiar with at this point.

I’ll give it time. Maybe apps can change that"
"Apple Vision Pro release is at 11pm for me, so I'ma stay up and watch the reviews flood in."
"All these apple vision pro reviews are pissing me off.

The only difference between Apple and competitors Meta and Sony is that only Apple has a customer base that has been programmed to pay ridiculous sums for shit that barely works.

Both those companies could make something…"

"The first reviews of the Apple Vision Pro. The Verge editor Nilay Patel praised the flagship hardware features of the new product. microOLED displays with 4K resolution for each eye display a high-quality and clear picture, although a dimming effect may be noticeable at the edges"
"On Apple Vision Pro, all the written & video reviews I’ve seen so far use this company line: “Apple calls this Spatial Computing.” And no one pushes back, is it really? Shouldn’t it be worth pushing back versus taking company buzzword for it? Is this an entirely new category?"

"I have to say.
I am a VR skeptic. The first and only time I used an oculus I got motion sick.
I saw a review for the Apple Vision Pro and it looks genuinely impressive and something I might buy."
"Early Apple Vision Pro reviews are confirming prognostications that the product will have a niche focus.

Looking forward, it's important for Apple to facilitate the building of an vibrant ecosystem so that more use cases can be presented to a wider audience in future iterations."
no offense but these apple vision pro reviews look so boring. someone show us a day in the life video or travel somewhere with it and show us what it’s like at home.!
"Most Apple Vision Pro reviews are quite dumb, missing the point on the revolution this piece of tech brings.

It’s like you can’t say Apple did something awesome otherwise gonna offend your sponsors"

"Multiple reports that online orders for Apple Vision Pro, originally scheduled for march are now expected 20-25 February. 
Are people cancelling their pre-order based on the reviews?"
Seems Apple Vision Pro delivery date has moved up back to late Feb. Maybe there have been some cancellations these past couple of days after people watch the early reviews…
MKBHD's review of the Apple Vision Pro makes me really want one.

Just watched a review of the Apple Vision Pro and all I can say is that it  will be insane once OF models start abusing those mad features.

"After watching all of the reviews and unboxing videos about the Apple Vision Pro…I still can’t justify buying one. 

Headsets just annoy me after a short amount of time."

All I will say is: One day"

idk

im underwhelmed from reviews

it might be going back."
"How old is this guy? You’re worried about messing up your hair? Dude! 

I’ve read dozens of reviews of the Apple Vision Pro and this is the whiniest review ever. Sounds like the guy is looking for reasons to dislike the device, versus telling you what it does and how well it does…"

After watching the embargo lift on Apple Vision Pro reviews yesterday I noticed majority of the reviews were the same coverage. So maybe the outlets were limited on what they could show and talk about until Friday. I just feel like it’s so many selling points that are not being…
"When I get the Apple Vision Pro on Friday my main focus and review will be on how well apps, Apple Arcade, and Steam link games hold up on it. I’m curious to see how well NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition plays on it.

"Again, Nilay with a banger of a review. That Apple Vision Pro review is exactly what I want from Tech Tubers."
I’ve been trying to avoid reviews & videos of Apple Vision Pro so I don’t spoil my experience but you all are making it hard. Trying to stay strong… 
"Saw a lot of reviews for the Apple Vision Pro, i don't feel excited about it."
Apple Vision Pro reviews should be compared with Google Glass reviews. Go back and look at how much slack has been given to both products for being first gen.
The Apple vision pro is not what we’ve think it is but let just wait for more reviews.
"About Apple Vision Pro review, the best line was ""Listen to me, do you really want a computer that is always looking at your hands."" LAMOOOO"
"After watching reviews, the Apple Vision Pro seems just like a Quest 3 with better hardware and iPadOS, but with fewer software features than the Quest. You can basically do all this already on a $500 headset. 1/2"
"Apple Vision Pro may be overhyped but that Verge review was just incredible. It's the kind of classy, journalistic, slickly produced reviews we need as we enter new form factors, UX, and digital behaviors."
I honestly am impressed with the Apple Vision Pro reviews. I expected this product to be in a much worse shape than what it’s in.
"While reading The Verge's review of the Apple Vision Pro, I was confused in some parts because it was written in a more instructional/personal style instead of a more formal tone until I watched the video and realized that it's the transcript with some edits. Lol."
The Apple Vision Pro with Personas and Persona 3 Reload reviews coming out on the same day is making me very confused

"Watching the review Videos on the Apple Vision Pro - it is IDENTICAL to the Microsoft HaloLens. Even more excited now! Looks amazing with ZERO latency issues, and being able to use MacOS, or VisionOS together will be incredible. I think the pricing was perfect for what you get."
"I'm waiting for all my friends to receive and review their Apple Vision Pro because right now current reviews don't seem like the price tag is worth it.

Thoughts?"
Just Finished The Verge's Apple Vision Pro review video! I don't have any issue with it! Pretty objective in my opinion.
"To all of the people I’ve seen with Apple Vision Pro reviews, not a single one of your channels has earned the credibility for me to even consider watching your video."
"Seeing the Apple Vision Pro reviews getting released brings me back to that time of when the Google Glass, and Microsoft HoloLens first released. And what a time it was. The only thing different now is Apple is in this.

And hopefully it has more staying power than those before."
The hype for Tm the apple vision pro was so real. But as the all the review from the uncontroversial people are come out. The magic of the vision pro hype is coming down by the minute and  the optimist in me is slowly fading away.
"The 
@verge

"Incredibly surprised (in a good way) to see that Verge did a very balanced review of the Apple Vision Pro. It's almost unlike them.

Watching a bunch of reviews, it's clear that this tech is not ready for widespread adoption. Bring Google Glass back!"
Verge review absolutely destroys the Apple Vision Pro by the end. Completely pointless product for now. I’ll try the in store demo and be glad I saved all that money.
"These Apple Vision Pro review
videos are unexpectedly boring"

The problem with the Apple Vision Pro reviews thus far? There aren't enough of them just providing an analysis of what's just fun about it. Everyone seems to approach it like it's investigative journalism vs. telling a tech enthusiast what they'll like about this product.
"Apple Vision Pro reviews. It’s like the best piece of tech right now, but at the same time doesn’t quite succeed delivering the best version of its own goals. It’s definitely a first generation product by what I’m being told and that makes me excited for the future of VR… Or…"

"Looks like CNBC is all in on the Apple Vision Pro. Perhaps because of the revenue from the ads they are running today. 

Very favorable review (relative to others), well-timed release at market open."
"Even after watching a bunch of Apple Vision Pro reviews today, I still don’t get it. The pricepoint makes zero sense for how little it can do.

Non-curated reviews of the Apple Vision Pro headset will be published tomorrow. We are talking about full-fledged reviews that are not supervised by Apple in any way.
"Any decent youtubers/x-creators that have their hands on the Apple Vision Pro who are putting out some hands on reviews? Really interested to see some critical reviews based on actual lengthy hands-on experience, not just feature hype."

"Watching top tech influencers review the Apple Vision Pro feels like a sci-fi comedy sequel! 

They've got the goggles, the mystery tech, and we're all waiting for the punchline.

Are they predicting the future, or just blocking out the haters in style? "
It’s kinda funny watching some tech journos twist themselves into pretzels trying to avoid saying anything bad about the Apple Vision Pro after they spent years dumping on mostly the same features from Magic Leap. Gotta make sure you get that next iPhone to review! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Every review I’m reading means Apple Vision Pro will be made a Titanium in gen2. Fatigue must be addressed before any cost cutting happens
"The Apple Vision Pro is interesting because you have tons of big tech reviewers who received early review units singing its praise & teasing it, but I don't see a lot of people that seem ultra excited about buying one on launch day for $3500. Are you buying one?  #VisionPro"

"I have now watched a dozen movies in the Apple Vision Pro. The movie theater environment in Apple TV has become my go to.

I watched the entire Back to the Future trilogy and it was like having my own personal Oled quality theater, it’s that good."
"Great time at the Apple Store trying the new Apple Vision Pro, which, unfortunately, I won’t buy because the reality projection is blurry and not even in HD. 
I have 20/20, my sight is perfect but when I wear it, it’s like the objects over 2ft from me are less than HD quality."
"Did a demo of the Apple Vision Pro today. The picture quality and passthrough are amazing, so is the 3D depth effects

Pinch to select/scroll works well, double pinch zoom not so much

Also it is really front heavy, it's uncomfortable to wear from the jump"
The way I could purchase an amazing quality fursuit head for the same price as an apple vision pro is crazy
Scrolling through TikTok and saw Ronnie Radke perform Watch The World Burn while wearing the Apple Vision Pro on his head... what's he trying to do? Record his POV for the performance or does he have a tab open on the side
"The metaverse economic potential was limited by:

Mark Zuckerberg says Meta Quest 3 is better than Apple Vision Pro in terms of price and performance
"Zuck begins his comparison between Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro with the big lie. Yes, Quest 3 does high-quality pass through when RECORDING but this is NOT the 1st person experience of the user - which is absolutely terrible... Most new users think their device is broken!!"

I tried Apple Vision Pro today the potential this thing has is incredible. Only complaints is that the quality of your actual surroundings could be a bit better but other than it works scary good. For 3.5k it’s still not justifiable but it’s a very nice and impressive product

"I tried the Apple Vision Pro this morning!!

Near as I can tell - and in fairness I haven't used one yet - but it seems that the image quality of the Apple Vision Pro is comparable to the Meta Quest 3 - and tbh Quest 3 is simply awesome. I mostly use it as a virtual cinema -  (turn everything up to a high bitrate)

The Apple Vision Pro costs R90K for nothing because it’s horrible quality
